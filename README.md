# Project-1
Developed a machine learning model to predict the level of structural damage to buildings  during earthquakes based on various features such as construction type, occupancy, and year  built.  Built and trained a XG Boost algorithm to predict building damage, achieving meaningful results  with metrics like Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and R-squared(RÂ²).
